    <string name="instruction_detailed">The game is very simple with a purpose of paying tribute to Kobe’s tragic death.
        The object of the game is to find all the hidden objects in the minimum number of scans possible.
        Tap on a cell to inspect it and reveal the tribute Kobe image. If no object is there, a number will appear telling
        you the total number of hidden images in the same row and column as the selected cell. Enjoy the game and as Kobe said “Mamba Out”!! </string>
